Here are some of the key operations that an online movie ticket booking system should support:

User registration and login: 
The system should allow users to register and create an account. Once registered, users should be able to log in to their accounts to view upcoming movie showtimes, book tickets, and manage their bookings.

Movie and showtime management: 
The system should allow movie theaters to add and manage movie listings, showtimes, and theater seating arrangements.

Seat selection and booking:
The system should allow users to select their preferred seats and book tickets for the selected movie and showtime.

Payment processing:
The system should support payment processing, allowing users to pay for their tickets online using various payment methods, such as credit cards, debit cards, and online payment systems.

Confirmation and ticket generation:
Once a ticket has been booked and payment has been processed, the system should generate a confirmation message and ticket, which can be printed or accessed electronically.

Ticket cancellation and refund:
In case of cancellation, the system should allow users to cancel their tickets and initiate a refund, if applicable.

Customer support: 
The system should provide customer support services, including online helpdesk, phone, and email support to assist users with any issues they may face while using the system.

Overall, an online movie ticket booking system should be designed to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for both theaters and movie-goers.
